# Parini Associati Wordpress Theme

_This repository is not maintained for public usage. It may spawn a more generic Wordpress+AngularJS theme at some point in the future_

This Wordpress theme uses AngularJS and it is SEO friendly.

## Installation

The theme requires:

- the [REST API](http://wordpress.org/plugins/json-api/) Wordpress plugin;
- Using permalinks compatible with HTML5 push-state URLs
- (optional) To translate the site it is suggested to use [WPML](http://wpml.org/)

Place the content of the `dist` folder generated with `grunt build` in a subfolder of `wp-content/themes` in your wordpress installation. The theme should now be present in the theme section of the Wordpress admin panel.
